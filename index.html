Accomplishments/Achievements
2016 Tech Star for Zillow Group
Named one of fifteen Tech Stars out of the 1200 Technological Positions for all of Zillow Group during the December 2016
“ZG Week”

Winner of 5 out of 6 Hack Weeks
Zillow has a semi-annual “Hack Week” where employees can work on any project that may benefit the company. A popular
vote and a panel of judges pick the two winning projects each Hack Week out of the roughly dozen projects at the Lincoln
office. Winning projects include:
Project ICE - An auditing tool that refactored a large volume of technical debt and created an audit report and paper
trail for billing and account management.
Positive Outlook - An automation tool used to read and process incoming investor emails containing rate data links and
attachments. UI for entering regex rules and a testing tool to check that the regex matches doesn’t overlap other rules.
Before this project, it took four people manually checking Outlook emails, following a spreadsheet of information on
where to download files with filename changes.
Node-ifications - A Node/Firebase push notification service to alert logged in clients of new leads, status changes,
rate update notifications, and caller ids for Instant/Group Dials
Object Archive - API with SDK which records only the differences of serializable java objects. The historical
differences can then be viewed by administrators through a side-by-side UI.
